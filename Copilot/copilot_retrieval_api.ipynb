To use a key card to unlock or lock Cybertruck from outside, position the card as shown and tap it against the card reader located approximately one third the way up of the driver's side door pillar. When Cybertruck detects the key card, the exterior lights flash, the mirrors unfold or fold \\\\(if Fold Mirrors is on\\\\), the horn sounds \\\\(if Lock Confirmation Sound is on\\\\), and the doors unlock or lock.** NOTE:** You may need to hold the key card against the transmitter for a few seconds.**Keys30 Owner's Manual**\\r\\n</page_32>\\r\\n<page_33>\\r\\n  \\r\\nOnce inside, power up Cybertruck by pressing the brake pedal within two minutes of scanning the key card \\\\(see [Starting and Powering Off on page 75]()\\\\). If you wait longer than two minutes, you must re\\\\-authenticate by placing the key card near one of the card readers located on the wireless phone chargers on the center console. When your key card is detected, your two\\\\-minute authentication period restarts.**NOTE:** If enabled, Walk\\\\-Away Door Lock \\\\(see [Walk\\\\-Away Door Lock on page 34]()\\\\) operates only when you walk away using a phone key. When you walk away carrying your key card, Cybertruck does not automatically lock.\\r\\n</page_33>\\r\\n<page_33>\\r\\n\\r\\n#### **Managing Keys**\\r\\n  \\r\\n To display a list of all keys that can access Cybertruck, touch **Controls** \\\\> **Locks**. An icon displays next to each key to indicate whether the key is a phone key or a key card. Use this list to manage keys that have access to Cybertruck. To add or delete keys, see [Adding Keys from the Touchscreen on page 32]().  \\r\\n Cybertruck supports up to 19 keys. When you reach this limit, you must delete a key before adding a new one.  \\r\\n You can pair a key card to multiple\\u202fTesla\\u202fvehicles. This prevents you from having to deal with multiple keys when you switch vehicles. Key cards can be paired and used with many vehicles at a time. Pairing with a vehicle enables you to access the vehicle and enable driving.** NOTE:** If you customize the name of a paired key card or key fob on one vehicle \\\\(by touching the pencil icon\\\\), any other vehicle to which the key card or key fob is authenticated also displays the changed name.\\r\\n</page_33>\\r\\n<page_33>\\r\\n\\r\\n##### ** Add a Phone Key**\\r\\n You can use a phone to access Cybertruck after you add your phone as a phone key. Before you begin pairing your phone key, ensure:\\r\\n-  \\u2022 Your phone's Bluetooth setting is turned on.\\r\\n-  \\u2022 The Tesla mobile app can access your phone's Bluetooth. On your phone, navigate to Settings, choose the Tesla mobile app, and ensure the Bluetooth setting is turned on.\\r\\n-  \\u2022 Allow the Tesla mobile app to access your location. For the best experience, keep the mobile app running in the background.\\r\\n-  \\u2022 Mobile access is enabled for your vehicle. On the touchscreen, touch **Controls** \\\\> **Safety **\\\\> **Allow Mobile Access**.** NOTE: **Cybertruck communicates with your phone using Bluetooth. Keep in mind that your phone must have enough battery power to support Bluetooth \\\\(some phones disable Bluetooth when the battery is low\\\\).  \\r\\n To add a phone key:\\r\\n-  1. Download the Tesla mobile app to your phone.\\r\\n-  2. Log in to the Tesla mobile app using your Tesla account username and password.** NOTE:** You must remain logged in to your Tesla account to use your phone to access Cybertruck.** NOTE:** Many convenience features for accessing Cybertruck, such as hands\\\\-free frunk, can only be used with the vehicle currently selected in the mobile app. If multiple vehicles are linked to your Tesla account, you must ensure that the vehicle you want to use such convenience features with is currently selected on the mobile app.**Keys31 Opening and Closing**![][image_JVjUJtfwx9nV2nvcgJe8mw==] \\r\\n</page_33>\\r\\n<page_34>\\r\\n- 3. While inside or near the vehicle, open the Tesla mobile app and touch **Set Up Phone Key** on the main screen, or navigate to **Security** \\\\> **Set Up Phone Key**.<br> You can also use an Apple Watch as a key. While inside or near the vehicle, open the Tesla mobile app on your Apple Watch and touch **Set Up Watch Key** \\\\(see [Mobile App for Apple Watch on page 66]()\\\\).\\r\\n-  4. Follow the prompts on the mobile app and vehicle touchscreen to set up your phone key.** NOTE:** You must have your key card available in order to set up a phone key.  \\r\\n Cybertruck can connect to three phone keys simultaneously. Therefore, if more than three phone keys are detected and you want to authenticate or pair a different phone, move the other connected phone key\\\\(s\\\\) out of range or turn off its Bluetooth setting.\\r\\n</page_34>\\r\\n\",\n",
